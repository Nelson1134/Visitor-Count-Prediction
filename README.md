# Visitor-Count-Prediction

In this project, I developed a robust data processing pipeline to efficiently clean and merge multiple datasets, including 167+ weather variables and estimated visitor counts, achieving a 15% reduction in data preprocessing time. Through exploratory data analysis, I identified key factors influencing visitor numbers, such as temperature, precipitation, and UV index, which significantly improved feature selection for predictive modeling. By implementing and optimizing Random Forest and Linear Regression models using Grid Search, the predictive models achieved an RÂ² of 0.33. Additionally, I designed an interactive visual dashboard to enable stakeholders to easily interpret and analyze weather-related visitor trends.
